Welcome to TYPO3 Extension Workshop
===================================

This workshop is about the basics of TYPO3 extensions.

Some "rules" for the workshop
-----------------------------

* You will write all the code yourself. The repository is available though, if you need
  help or are to lazyâ€¦ .

* We will not call APIs without checking out their code. Always understand what your
  own code does.

* I'm using the latest TYPO3 CMS 8 LTS, most of the parts are so basic, they should
  work from 4.5 onwards.

* Ask questions as soon as possible. This way we have the context.

* All materials are available on Github: https://github.com/DanielSiepmann/typo3-extension-workshop

* When should we make breaks? Any Smokers here?
